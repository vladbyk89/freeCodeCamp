          Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a renowned scientist who designed the
          world's first hydro-electric power plant in Niagara Falls, which in
          the 1890s successfully distributed and illuminated distant homes and
          industries using his low current, high voltage electricity supply.
          Renowned in his time as an eccentric, mad scientist, the Serbian was
          also a prolific inventor who helped usher in the Second Industrial
          Revolution with his many technological marvels, for which he has been
          called 'The Man Who Invented the 20th Century'. As the scientific
          genius once famously said: “Let the future tell the truth, and
          evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The
          present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is
          mine.”

          Nikola Tesla was born at midnight on July 10, 1856 during an
          electrical storm. According to family lore, the midwife helping to
          deliver Nikola believed the lightning to be a bad omen and said he
          would be a child of darkness. His mother, however, said: “No. He will
          be a child of light.” In a twist of fate, he later became known as the
          father of electricity.

          Tesla possessed a photographic memory, along with lucid powers of
          visualization, and as a result rarely composed diagrams of his
          inventions, but worked from memories and pictures in his mind. He also
          suffered from an affliction in which blinding flashes of light would
          appear before his eyes, often accompanied by hallucinations. Much of
          the time the visions were linked to a word or idea he might come
          across, and on hearing its name he would involuntarily envision it in
          vivid detail, much in the same way as modern day synesthete
